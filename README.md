- that aimed at water quality, water health, environmental monitoring, detailed mapping, manometer, and soil geological on-boaed autonomous UAV. 
- The first project is a simple edge water quality sensor pack but with two novel elements and two novel power systems in addition to a solar hat. 
- This will bring the lab to the water at low power, long range, early warning of pollution release, bacterial growth, parasites, and a wide range of chemical
- and human and animal matabolites and organic and inorganic identification and concentration for watersheds and coastlines or sensitive reef areas.

- Autonomous underwater multi-spectral sonar and manometer etc...
- Coastal options (Buoy) - Watershed (rail mounted with underwater and above water element - on board ML via Jetson or like) 
- Use Cases NGO, Gov't, Corporate Compliance, Environmental Activist, Health Organizations
